# Data Field Job Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into job positions and salaries within the data field, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. By employing Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we conducted comprehensive data cleaning, visualization, and analysis primarily in Google Colab and DataSpell environments. The goal was to extract meaningful insights and trends from the dataset to aid in understanding the job market dynamics in the data field.

## Dataset

The dataset titled "Jobs and Salaries in the Data Field" comprises various columns, including:

- `work_year`
- `experience_level`
- `employment_type`
- `job_title`
- `salary`
- `salary_currency`
- `salary_in_usd`
- `employee_residence`
- `work_setting`
- `company_location`
- `company_size`
- `job_category`

The dataset provides valuable information about job positions, salaries, and related attributes within the data field, enabling us to analyze trends and patterns in the job market.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before conducting analysis, we performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and addressing inconsistencies to ensure the dataset's integrity and reliability for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) played a crucial role in uncovering insights from the dataset. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we explored relationships between variables, identified trends, and gained a deeper understanding of factors influencing job positions and salaries in the data field.

## Google Colab and DataSpell

Google Colab and DataSpell served as our primary environments for conducting data analysis tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of Python and the aforementioned libraries, we executed data cleaning, visualization, and analysis workflows efficiently. The collaborative nature of these platforms enabled seamless collaboration and sharing of insights among team members.
